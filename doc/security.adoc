=== Security as a layer
It is easy to add security as a layer to your application.  In the `security` package we
have a filter called BasicAuthenticationLayer that demos how to protect a url and inject
information about who is authenticated directly into the REST service.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/secure                   <= 400 We just got RuntimeException of type 'NotAuthorizedException'.
curl -i --user ole:bole http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/secure   <= 200 OK
```

[NOTE]
You will not get "HTTP 401 Unauthorized" when NotAuthorizedException is thrown as you expected.
The reason is that our ExceptionMapperUnhandled eats all RunTimeExceptions (including NotAuthorizedException) and maps them to HTTP 400 and a text message.
