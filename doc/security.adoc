=== Security as a layer
It is easy to add security as a layer to your application.  In the `security` package we
have a filter called BasicAuthenticationLayer that demos how to protect a url and inject
information about who is authenticated directly into the REST service.
```
curl -I http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/secure                   <= 401 Unauthorized
curl -i --user ole:bole http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/secure   <= 200 OK
```
