== How to use JCache JSR-107
The JCache is only enabled when Payara Micro runs in cluster mode (which is default), take a look in the
`cache` package for an example.  It can be tested with the following curl commands :
```
curl http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/cache/123
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/cache/123
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/cache/all
```
