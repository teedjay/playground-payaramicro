=== Metrics API 1.1
You can obtain some basic metrics about the Java RunTime in Prometheus format (default) or JSON directly.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/metrics
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

If you only want too see the application metrics you could limit to :
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/metrics/application
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:8080/metrics/application
```

To generate some metrics call the `metricsdemo` resource a few times before re-checking the metrics url.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/metricsdemo (random sleep)
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/metricsdemo/{millis} (sleep time in millis)
```
