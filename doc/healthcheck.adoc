===  Health Check API 1.0
You can easily provide health information in a standard way.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
```

Take a look into the `healthcheck` package to see a couple of code examples.
One should always return "up" while the other will pseudo-randomly flip status.

If the overall status is DOWN you should get a `503 Service Unavailable` response and a payload with details :
```
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "data": {},
            "name": "flipper",
            "state": "DOWN"
        },
        {
            "data": {
                "free": "10gb"
            },
            "name": "archive",
            "state": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "outcome": "DOWN"
}
```

If the overall status is UP you should get a `200 OK` response and a payload with details :
```
{
    "checks": [
        {
            "data": {
                "free": "10gb"
            },
            "name": "archive",
            "state": "UP"
        },
        {
            "data": {},
            "name": "flipper",
            "state": "UP"
        }
    ],
    "outcome": "UP"
}
```
