=== Events
It is very easy to create events based applications with CDI in JEE7.  In the `events` package we
have crated a two event listeners ("observers") and a REST resource that send an event when triggered.

The actual event is just a normal Java bean and to send it you @Inject a typed event and fire new events with it.

To receive events you annotate your event listening methods to @Observes the typed events and do whatever you need to be done.

To send a new event use the curl command below.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/events
Expect HTTP 200 with the sent message in the response body
```

Expected result is that both observers beeing triggered, each logging the received event message to the server log.
