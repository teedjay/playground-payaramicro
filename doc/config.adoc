=== Config API 1.1
By using the Config API it is possible to inject configuration directly into your code.
Default config override order is System Properties -> Environment Variables -> microprofile-config.properties

In the package `config` you'll find a small webservice that returns a config read from the properties file :
```
curl http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/config
```
