=== ExceptionMapper
It is possible to catch unhandled Exceptions using the jax-rs ExceptionMapper feature.
Take a look into the `exception` package and the `ExceptionMapperUnhandled` class to
see how this work.

You can trigger RuntimeExceptions by using the `ExceptionTriggerResource`, a division by
zero will generate a ArithmeticException that will be mapped to HTTP 400 BAD_REQUEST with
a simple text/plain message.
```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/2      <== returns 10/2
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/0      <== 10/0 trigges ArithmeticException and will be mapped
```

You can throw any exception by passing the full class name
```
Catched by the ExceptionMapperUnhandled (catches all RuntimeExceptions) :
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/throw?class=java.langIllegalStateException
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/throw?class=javax.ws.rs.WebApplicationException

Catched by the ExceptionMapperThrowable (catches Throwables, like exception and error) :
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/throw?class=no.such.Exception          <== Exception
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/throw?class=java.io.IOException        <== Exception
curl -i http://localhost:8080/payaramicro/rest/exception/throw?class=java.lang.ThreadDeath      <== Error
```
