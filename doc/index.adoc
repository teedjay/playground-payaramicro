= Payara Micro Playground

This project demonstrate different JEE features using Payara Micro.

Each chapter corresponds to a Java code package with the same name
that aims to demonstrate and describe one feature.

All code is standard JEE7 or MicroProfile and should easily run on JEE servers like
https://www.payara.fish/payara_micro[Payara Micro],
http://wildfly-swarm.io[WildFly Swarm],
http://tomee.apache.org[TomEE] and
https://openliberty.io[OpenLiberty].

It should also work great with module based runtimes as
https://ee.kumuluz.com[kumuluzEE] and
https://hammock-project.github.io[Hammock].
